# 3D-Pac-Man
Starter Code for the PacMan Project.
Unity Version: 2023.2.5f1

This 3D Pac-Man game takes the classic arcade experience to a new dimension with a dynamic virtual world, deviating from the traditional maze setup. Players control Pac-Man as he navigates a rich environment filled with terrains, trees, grass, and water, all while collecting food pellets to maintain his energy.

Key Features:

1. 3D Environment:
  
   A fully designed world with varied terrains showcasing buildings and architectures based on Lafayette, Louisiana, allowing Pac-Man to move, jump, and even duck under obstacles. 
2. Pellets and Hazards:
  
   Pac-Man automatically chomps his way through the environment, collecting food pellets to sustain his energy. Watch out for "bad pellets" laid by enemy creatures, which reduce Pac-Manâ€™s life by 5% if consumed.
3. Enemies and Mega-Chomp:
  
   Enemy creatures actively spawn and chase Pac-Man, posing a constant threat. Players can activate the "Mega-Chomp" power after eating fruits in the terrain to become invincible temporarily, allowing them to gobble up enemies and pellets. However, using this power decreases Pac-Man's energy, slowing his pace.
4. Scoring and Energy Display:
  
   The game features a scoring mechanism displayed on-screen, along with Pac-Man's current energy level to keep players informed and engaged.
5. Game Menus:
  
   Includes a start screen, an end screen, and a game-over screen with an option to restart the game.
6. Sound Effects:
  
   Immersive sound effects enhance the gameplay experience, providing audio cues for actions like pellet collection, enemy encounters, and Mega-Chomp activation.
